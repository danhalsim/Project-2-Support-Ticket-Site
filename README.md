# Project 2 - Support Ticket Site

## Description

A company app that can be used by both clients filing support tickets and technicians who handle the tickets through the app, with the ability to communicate with each other within the system.

### User Story & Acceptance Criteria:

* As a client:
 I want to file a support ticket, speak to a technician, and be updated on the status of my ticket until it is fulfilled.

* It is done when the Application uses a Node and Express back end and uses both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. This allows the customer to post a new support ticket and get updates on its progress.
* It is done when the client can use the individual ticket's page to submit messages in its history to communicate with the technician assigned to the client's ticket.
---
* As a technician:
* I want to see all support tickets, assign myself to work on one, be able to speak with the client, and notify the client of when it is done and ready to be reviewed.

* It is done when the technician has the ability to assign a support ticket to himself.
* It is done when the technician can access the same line of communication as the client to pass along support information.
* It is done when the technician can change the status of the ticket's progress, but not mark it as done, which only the client can mark as a satisfied support ticket.
